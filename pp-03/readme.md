1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=14W0u0k07++04+M04+M0H++0H++
Your Rationale: A background color of white would make any choices of color (depending on the console) stands out in the page, and a dark color(grey and black in this case) would grab people's attention and make the contents easy to memorize.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=52N0C0koqsWwbjXiNvFabupnYj6
Your Rationale: I chose green as my background color because that's the color people would relate to easily when it is a website about a springtime tour in a garden, light blue is a good color for important messages since it is eye catching in a website that has a green background.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=3050u0k8T-Q1UV64XLLdBsSjcni
Your Rationale: a colorful website can grab kids' attentions and make them develop the interests into learning alphabet. The combination of pink, light green and light blue can motivate kids to keep learning.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=c5C21453h0kJQpMt1CGFZvyNOkOSnf5
Your Rationale: the color of red gives its target audience a sense of alert, which is what cybersecurity mainly about. Different color I picked besides red gives a diversity in colors for this website, makes it more interesting to browse.
